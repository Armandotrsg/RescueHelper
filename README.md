# Rescue Helper

## Description
Rescue Helper is a system designed to assist in rescue efforts in case of building collapse. The system utilizes a Raspberry Pi and accelerometer to measure earthquake intensity in Python, and a camera programmed with Tensorflow Lite and OpenCV to count people in a room. The data from these sensors is visualized on a webpage called Rescue Helpers, which allows for quick and efficient rescue efforts. The repository for this project contains only the webpage, where you can access the people count in one room and check the actual vibrations of the building.
